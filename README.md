# 🏃‍♂️ Calories Burnt Prediction - ML Project

This project focuses on predicting the number of calories burnt during physical activity using machine learning techniques. The dataset used was synthetically generated from a deep learning model trained on the original Calories Burnt Prediction dataset, with slightly modified feature distributions.

## 📌 Overview

The goal is to:
- Explore and preprocess biometric and activity data
- Train regression models to predict calorie expenditure
- Build a simple Streamlit web app for interactive predictions

---

## 🧠 Machine Learning Workflow

- Data Cleaning & Exploration (EDA)
- Feature Engineering
- Model Training (Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.)
- Evaluation (MAE, RMSE, R² Score)
- Model Deployment (via Streamlit)
